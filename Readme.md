# EcoFresh Static Website

This repository contains a small static site for EcoFresh (HTML + CSS).

Photos used for hero backgrounds are loaded from Unsplash via the Source API (no local images included):

- Home hero: https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?eco,cleaning,home
- About hero: https://source.unsplash.com/1400x700/?person,cleaning

These images come from Unsplash and may vary on reload; if you'd prefer fixed images committed locally, upload the desired JPG/PNG files and I will add them into the `Images/` folder and update the CSS to reference them.

Attribution: Images served via Unsplash Source are free to use under the Unsplash License. If you want explicit attribution for specific photos, I can fetch and save particular images and add credits in this README.
